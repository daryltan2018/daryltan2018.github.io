1. I write my thoughts and notes on Notes. Itâ€™s quick to use, stored on the cloud and easily accessible from either my Macbook or iPhone.

2. I maintain a simple to do list on my laptops - two text files on what to work on today and for the week.

3. For every book I read, I write marginalia. 

4. I type out quotes and passages from the books I read and store them under folders categorized by author.

5.  I use a framework of Do, Delegate, Delete and Defer to keep my inbox to zero.

6. I say no to most things so that I can do the things that I want to do.

7. I  have no social media apps on my phone.

8. For all my ideas, I test them by doing them.

9. I do first things first.

10. I focus on one thing at a time.
