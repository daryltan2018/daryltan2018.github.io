I started the year reading *The New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin*. It delves into the circumstances leading to the rise and rule of Vladimir Putin against the backdrop of the Cold War and communist Russia.   

I also read Peter Drucker's *The Effective Executive* for the second time. The first time was because Jeff Bezos recommended it. It's a classic book written many years ago on the role of the executive and is applicable even in today's corporations.  

Another classic that I read again was Viktor Frankl's *Man's Search for Meaning*. Part biography, part psychology book, he recounts the time he spent as a prisoner of war and his experience during the Holocaust.  

Other books worth mentioning include Nassim Taleb's *Antifragile*, *The Self-Driven Child* by William Stixrud, *It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy At Work* by Jason Fried and David Heinmeier Hansson and *On Writing Well* by William Zinsser. 

While I've read mostly on Kindle,  I listened to a few audiobooks during my commute to work:  

*Why Nations Fail* on the impact of extractive and inclusive political systems on the fortune's of a country; *The Age of Absurdity* which is a modern day take on the trappings of today's societies; *The Undoing Project* which recounts the interwoven lives of the two psychology professors Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman; *Dreamland* - a harrowing tale on the opiate addiction in America and how it all started; *Bad Blood* - the story of Eliziabeth Holmes, the fallen founder of Theranos.
