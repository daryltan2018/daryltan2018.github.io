## What is Aristotle's view on Ethics?

Aristotle takes the view that we study ethics in order to improve our lives and therefore its principal concern is the nature of human well-being. He recognises that there are different views as to what is good for humans. The difficulty is not in recognising what is good but which is the highest good. 

## What is the Highest Good?

To him, the highest good is living well (Eudaimon). Eudaimon is the highest end and all subordinate goals (health, wealth and other resources). Living well consists in doing something, not just being in a certain state or condition. It consists in those lifelong activities that actualize the virtues of the rational part of the soul.
