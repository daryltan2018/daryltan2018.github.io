<h1>{{page.title}}</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm Daryl.</p>

<p>
I started this <a href="/blog">blog</a> to write and reflect on my life, dealing with others, and about the <a href="/reading">books that I've read</a> that helped inspire me.
</p>	

<p>
I'm also starting a <a href="/newsletter">newsletter</a> to share the books that I've read, reviewed and find worth reading. If you're interested, just <a href="mailto:daryltan2007@yahoo.com.sg">email me</a> with your email address and I will include you in my monthly newsletter.
</p>
