    <h1>Why I Moved To Wordpress</h1>
<em><p>Written on 25 January 2019</p></em> 		


<p>I was using Jekyll and Github pages but decided to make the jump to Wordpress.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintaining the code for my old website was time consuming. I didn’t want to spend more time coding than blogging</li>
  <li>Wordpress has more features. It allows comments, widgets, and various other useful plugins</li>
  <li>Less not more options in terms of customisation meant less headache making unimportant decisions over font size, margins etc</li>
  <li>I actually like writing on my phone as opposed to writing on my computer since it’s easy to reach</li>
  <li>Synchronisation with ia writer resulting in less “friction” and faster publishing</li>
</ul>
