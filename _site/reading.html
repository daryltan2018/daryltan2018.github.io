	  <h1>My Favourite Books</h1>

<p>
	
I've always loved reading books ever since I was a child. Obviously because it's an enjoyable pursuit. But another often neglected reason is because it helps me become a better person. How to live. How to learn. Growing wiser each day. I've put together a list of books that have impacted me and helped make me who I am today. 

</p>

<p>
	
<strong>Letters from a Stoic</strong> by Seneca. I first listened to a Guide to the Good Life last year and subsequently purchased this book after. Lots of great advice from one of the all time underrated philosophers of ancient time. I enjoyed the first part of the book more so than towards the end where the letters tended to ramble and become more incoherent but still, full of insight and actionable advice.

<strong>The Effective Executive</strong> by Peter Drucker. I read <em>The Effective Executive</em> for the second time in 2018. The first time was because Jeff Bezos recommended it. It's a classic book written many years ago on the role of the executive and is applicable even in today's corporations. The greatest takeaway from his book: "If there is any one secret of effectiveness , it is concentration . Effective executives do first things first and they do one thing at a time." 

</p>

<p><strong>Man’s Search For Meaning</strong> by Viktor Frankl. Another classic that I read again was Viktor Frankl’s <em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em>. Part autobiography, part psychology book, he recounts the time he spent as a prisoner of war and his experience during the Holocaust. His belief that a person can find meaning in life even in times of hardship is a tremendous inspiration to me.</p>
