    <h1>Reading Habits</h1>


<p>One of the things that I would like to do with this blog is to post my thoughts and feelings on the books that I’m reading. I’ve been reading passively for a while now and I regret not taking notes of the books that I’ve read all these years.</p>

<p>The best time to start is today. Second best time to start tomorrow.</p>

<p>Next up - Seneca: A Life by Emily Wilson</p>
