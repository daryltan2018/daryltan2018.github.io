    <h1>The Story Of Philosophy</h1>
<p>By <a href="/">Daryl</a> on 16 November 2019</p> 


<p>In “The Story of Philosophy”, Will Durant, dives deep into the lives of some of the most famous philosophers - Aristotle, Plato, Nietzsche, Kant, Spinoza and more. The more I read, the more I wanted to learn about philosophy; the different schools of thought and their champions. And as I read I realised that the terms were shockingly alien to me. What is <a href="/Metaphysics">metaphysics</a>? What is <a href="/Epistemology">epistemology</a>? What is truth? What is morality? So as I explored further, I remembered listening to the podcast “The Partially Examined Life”. Listening chronologically to the podcast gave me some semblance of a structure as I started to chip away at the tip of this very large iceberg. Perhaps if this project keeps my interest I will write a bit more specifically on some of the more interesting topics.</p>
