<h2 id="what-is-the-categorical-imperative">What is the Categorical Imperative?</h2>

<p>The Categorical Imperative is the fundamental principle of our moral <strong>duty</strong>. The term was coined by Immanuel Kant. It is categorical because it applies to us <em>unconditionally</em>, without consideration of the consequences.</p>

<h2 id="the-universal-law-of-nature">The Universal Law of Nature</h2>

<p>According to Kant, this is the first formulation of the Categorical Imperative, which you are to &#8220;act only in accordance with that maxim (..) which you can (..) will that it become a universal law&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="the-humanity-formula">The Humanity Formula</h2>

<p>According to Kant, we should never act in such a way that we treat humanity as a a means only but always as an end in itself.</p>

<h2 id="the-autonomy-formula">The Autonomy Formula</h2>

<p>According to Kant, we should legislate our universal laws according to our status as rational beings with autonomy.</p>

<h2 id="the-kingdom-of-ends-formula">The Kingdom of Ends Formula</h2>

<p>It is a Kantian formulation for &#8220;A Systematic union of different rational beings under common laws&#8221;.</p>

<p>It argues that our primary moral obligation is acting only on principles that are accepted by a community of fully rational agents.</p>
