    <h1>The Books I Read In 2018</h1>
<em><p>Written on 22 December 2018</p></em> 		


<p>I started the year reading <em>The New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin</em>. It delves into the circumstances leading to the rise and rule of Vladimir Putin against the backdrop of the Cold War and communist Russia.</p>

<p>I also read Peter Drucker’s <em>The Effective Executive</em> for the second time. The first time was because Jeff Bezos recommended it. It’s a classic book written many years ago on the role of the executive and is applicable even in today’s corporations.</p>

<p>Another classic that I read again was Viktor Frankl’s <em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em>. Part biography, part psychology book, he recounts the time he spent as a prisoner of war and his experience during the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Other books worth mentioning include Nassim Taleb’s <em>Antifragile</em>, <em>The Self-Driven Child</em> by William Stixrud, <em>It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy At Work</em> by Jason Fried and David Heinmeier Hansson and <em>On Writing Well</em> by William Zinsser.</p>

<p>While I’ve read mostly on Kindle,  I listened to a few audiobooks during my commute to work:</p>

<p><em>Why Nations Fail</em> on the impact of extractive and inclusive political systems on the fortune’s of a country; <em>The Age of Absurdity</em> which is a modern day take on the trappings of today’s societies; <em>The Undoing Project</em> which recounts the interwoven lives of the two psychology professors Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman; <em>Dreamland</em> - a harrowing tale on the opiate addiction in America and how it all started; <em>Bad Blood</em> - the story of Eliziabeth Holmes, the fallen founder of Theranos.</p>
