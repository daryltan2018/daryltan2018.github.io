    <h1>Inner Scorecard</h1>
<em><p>Written on 23 January 2019</p></em> 		


<p>We must establish an inner model to serve as touchstone of our actions, by which we at times favour ourselves or flog ourselves. I have my own laws and law-court to pass judgment on me and I appeal to them rather than elsewhere. No one but you knows whether you are base and cruel, or loyal and dedicated. Others never see you: they surmise about you from uncertain conjectures; they do not see your nature so much as your artifice. So do not cling to their sentence: cling to your own. - Montaigne</p>
