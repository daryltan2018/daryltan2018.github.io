    <h1>Epistemology</h1>


<h2 id="what-is-epistemology">What is Epistemology?</h2>
<p>It is the study of <em>knowledge</em> and <em>justified belief</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-knowledge">What is Knowledge?</h2>
<p>The particular knowledge is pertaining to the knowledge of a proposition. Three conditions are necessary for knowledge - Truth, belief and justification. A proposition needs to be true, therefore knowledge requires truth. A person needs to believe it to be true, therefore knowledge requires belief. A person needs to be correct in the proposition with the right justification (as opposed to luck), therefore knowledge requires justification.</p>
