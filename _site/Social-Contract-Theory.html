<p>Social contract is a theory concerning with the legitimacy of the authority of the state over the individual. It argues that individuals have consented, either explicitly or tacitly, to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority (of the ruler, or to the decision of a majority) in exchange for protection of their remaining rights or maintenance of the social order.</p>
