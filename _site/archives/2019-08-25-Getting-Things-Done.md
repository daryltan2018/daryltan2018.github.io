Because of work commitments, there's been a lack of updates from me..

But on Friday, while wandering around a bookstore, I saw an updated version of David Allen's GTD on the shelf. Purchased a copy and eased myself into a chair in the nearby cafe, I started to get excited about implementing some of his ideas into my own GTD system. In fact this post stemmed from some of those ideas and breathed a bit of life into this dying blog.

But the bottom line version is that using a mix of Apple reminders, lists and an enlightened understanding of what getting things done means, I'm experimenting with a new method of being more productive...

Getting Things Done (or GTD) is all about actions and outcomes.

So for instance, this blog post is an outcome. Sitting in front of my laptop and typing it out is an action.

To implement the framework, I needed a tool for capturing and what better tool than my trusty "Reminders" app. I captured various ideas, errands, projects, stuff .. everything that David Allen calls an "open loop" into the app.

Next, all the stuff that I received, I clarified by asking myself if it was actionable. If yes, then I figured out what the next action is. If no, then I trashed it or put it into incubation for later.

Once I had all my open loops, I organised them into various lists named under different contexts like home, office, errands etc.

Then I reflected on all the items I had and decided, given the 4 levels of constraints (context, time, energy and priority) on which task to engage first.

It's a damm useful framework for procrastinators like me.
