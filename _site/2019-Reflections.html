    <h1>2019 Reflections</h1>

<p>Looking back on 2019, I’ve some achievements worth noting.</p>

<p><em>I quit social media.</em> No more Facebook, no more Twitter and no more Instagram. The biggest gain was more time spent reading, being present with family and surprisingly, the joy of missing out.</p>

<p><em>I read a lot more books.</em> Over the years, I’ve steadily increased the number of books that I’ve read. (as evidenced <a href="The-Books-I-read-in-2019">here</a>, <a href="The-Books-I-read-in-2018">here</a> and <a href="/The-Books-I-read-in-2017">here</a>)</p>

<p><em>I started a blog.</em> Admittedly though, the quality of the writing is varied. But it is a writing experiment after all, so it is only natural that some would prove more fruitful than others.</p>

<p><em>I also learned how difficult it is to…</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>be a parent</li>
  <li>be a boss</li>
  <li>be a programmer</li>
  <li>be a writer</li>
  <li>be a reader</li>
  <li>be a philosopher</li>
  <li>be honest (with oneself)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>For 2020.</em> I want to continue to focus on the things that are most important to me. My family, my work, reading and writing. And cultivating and sharpening these values (as espoused by Walter Kaufmann in his book “Faith of A Heretic” - (1) Courage, (2) Humbition (Humility &amp; Ambition), (3) Honesty and (4) Love.</p>
