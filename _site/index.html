      <h1>Rick Roderick</h1>
      <p><p>I’m embarking on a project. Each week I will go through <a href="http://rickroderick.org/">Rick Roderick’s</a>
lecture in sequence and blog about what I’ve learned.</p>
</p>
						
  
      <h1>The Story Of Philosophy</h1>
      <p><p>In “The Story of Philosophy”, Will Durant, dives deep into the lives of some of the most famous philosophers - Aristotle, Plato, Nietzsche, Kant, Spinoza and more. The more I read, the more I wanted to learn about philosophy; the different schools of thought and their champions. And as I read I realised that the terms were shockingly alien to me. What is <a href="/Metaphysics">metaphysics</a>? What is <a href="/Epistemology">epistemology</a>? What is truth? What is morality? So as I explored further, I remembered listening to the podcast “The Partially Examined Life”. Listening chronologically to the podcast gave me some semblance of a structure as I started to chip away at the tip of this very large iceberg. Perhaps if this project keeps my interest I will write a bit more specifically on some of the more interesting topics.</p>
</p>
						
  
      <h1>Jekyll</h1>
      <p><p>I’ve been working on a side web log for some of the philosophy readings I’ve been doing and on a lark I thought of migrating my wordpress blog back to Jekyll.</p>

<p>The joy of a simple design and workflow of terminal + ia writer + GitHub pages makes it worthwhile.</p>
</p>
						
  
      <h1>Are Your Lights On</h1>
      <p><p>I’m a fan of Jerry Weinberg and though he’s gone, his brilliant writings still remain.</p>

<p>The latest book I’ve been reading from him is a quirky one called Are your lights on?</p>

<p>It’s really about problems and asking the right questions- too often we jump into the solution and realise much later than the problem is really something else. I’ve been guilty of that so many times at work especially when you’re used to doing a piece of repetitive work a certain way and realise halfway through that the problem is an entirely different thing altogether.</p>

<p>So yes, this book is a timely reminder that before we jump headfirst into any problem, we should ask what is the problem about.</p>

<p>In fact, we should go further. Sometimes we should also ask is this my problem? If not, we should not solve other people’s problems for them. It just ends up in more pain for everyone.</p>

<p>Finally, we should ask ourselves if the problem is even worth solving at all. There are so many problems out there with either no solution or just not worth the hassle.</p>

<p>Once again, highly recommended.</p>

      <h1>Getting Things Done</h1>
      <p><p>Because of work commitments, there’s been a lack of updates from me..</p>

<p>But on Friday, while wandering around a bookstore, I saw an updated version of David Allen’s GTD on the shelf. Purchased a copy and eased myself into a chair in the nearby cafe, I started to get excited about implementing some of his ideas into my own GTD system. In fact this post stemmed from some of those ideas and breathed a bit of life into this dying blog.</p>

<p>But the bottom line version is that using a mix of Apple reminders, lists and an enlightened understanding of what getting things done means, I’m experimenting with a new method of being more productive…</p>

<p>Getting Things Done (or GTD) is all about actions and outcomes.</p>

<p>So for instance, this blog post is an outcome. Sitting in front of my laptop and typing it out is an action.</p>

<p>To implement the framework, I needed a tool for capturing and what better tool than my trusty “Reminders” app. I captured various ideas, errands, projects, stuff .. everything that David Allen calls an “open loop” into the app.</p>

<p>Next, all the stuff that I received, I clarified by asking myself if it was actionable. If yes, then I figured out what the next action is. If no, then I trashed it or put it into incubation for later.</p>

<p>Once I had all my open loops, I organised them into various lists named under different contexts like home, office, errands etc.</p>

<p>Then I reflected on all the items I had and decided, given the 4 levels of constraints (context, time, energy and priority) on which task to engage first.</p>

<p>It’s a damm useful framework for procrastinators like me.</p>
