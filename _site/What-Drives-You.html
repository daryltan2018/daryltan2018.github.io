    <h1>What Drives You</h1>


<p>What drives you? What breathes energy and invigorates your soul? Is it the desire to please your boss? To feel the showers of praise from your neighbours and admirers? Is it the golden chest of financial reward - the fattening bank balance?</p>

<p>When I first started my career in a bank, I had the wrong intentions. I looked for something that was financially attractive and spent 4 years in a vocation that I hated. I learned then that if you tie your happiness, your well-being, your purpose to externals, you are bound to be disappointed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>” If you live according to nature , you will never be poor ; if you live according to opinion , you will never be rich .” - Seneca</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of looking toward extrinsic rewards, we should be looking inwardly - towards things that are intrinsically meaningful in itself. Just like a craftsman who works on his craft purely because he enjoys it. Writing this blog provides me with no extrinsic rewards - I don’t get paid for it, I don’t have an audience that reads my writing. It also requires a great deal of time and it is frustratingly difficult at times but I feel a sense of achievement every time I cross a hurdle or succesfully put my thoughts to paper.</p>
