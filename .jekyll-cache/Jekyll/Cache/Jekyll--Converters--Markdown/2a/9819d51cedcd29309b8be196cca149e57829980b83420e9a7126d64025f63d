I"˚<p>The catalyst for me starting the <a href="/notes">philosophy</a> project was the book ‚ÄúThe Story of Philosophy‚Äù. The writer, Will Durant, dives deep into the lives of some of the most famous philosophers - Aristotle, Plato, Nietzsche, Kant, Spinoza and more. The more I read, the more I wanted to learn about philosophy; the different schools of thought and their champions. And as I read I realised that the terms were shockingly alien to me. What is metaphysics? What is ethics? What is truth?</p>
