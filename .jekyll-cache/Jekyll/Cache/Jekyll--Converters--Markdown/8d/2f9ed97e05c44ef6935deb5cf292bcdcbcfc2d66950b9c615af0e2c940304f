<p>In the philosophy of mind, dualism is the theory that the mental and the physical (mind vs body) are radically different things.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-substance-dualism">What is Substance Dualism?</h2>
<p>Descartes was a substance dualist. He believed that there were two kinds of substance: matter, of which the essential property is that it is spatially extended; and mind, of which the essential property is that it thinks.</p>

<p>The main uncertainty that faced Descartes and his contemporaries, however, was not where interaction took place, but how two things so different as thought and extension could interact at all.</p>
