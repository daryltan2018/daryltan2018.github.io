I"ü<p>I was using Jekyll and Github pages but decided to make the jump to Wordpress.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintaining the code for my old website was time consuming. I didn‚Äôt want to spend more time coding than blogging</li>
  <li>Wordpress has more features. It allows comments, widgets, and various other useful plugins</li>
  <li>Less not more options in terms of customisation meant less headache making unimportant decisions over font size, margins etc</li>
  <li>I actually like writing on my phone as opposed to writing on my computer since it‚Äôs easy to reach</li>
  <li>Synchronisation with ia writer resulting in less ‚Äúfriction‚Äù and faster publishing</li>
</ul>
