I"¬	<p>What is the meaning of life? What is it all for? Three thousand years ago, Socrates (or Plato) once said, ‚Äúthe unexamined life is not worth living‚Äù, so it is that we must pursue this means of the Socratic critical inquiry or man‚Äôs search for meaning. The Greeks thought it could be summed up in one word - Excellence but what exactly does that mean? To the Romans, it meant different things to different groups. There was Hedonism or <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/#EpicLife">Epicureanism</a>, which was the pursuit of the ‚Äúhigher pleasures‚Äù. There was also <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/">Stocisim</a> that championed fortitude and cultivating apathy towards one‚Äôs life. Yet the doctrine had still not solved the ultimate question of meaning which is where <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/christiantheology-philosophy/">Christianity</a> spread and gave meaning to the suffering where Stoicism did not. And with the rise of Christianity came the rise of the Catholic Church that propagated for thousands of years through fire and blood. Till the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/">enlightenment</a> or the age of reason. That‚Äôs where <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/">Immanuel Kant</a>, who championed that the individual is free and the motto of the enlightenment was for all to ‚Äúdare to use their own reason‚Äù. It is this autonomy that is central to Kant‚Äôs entire ethical theory (the Categorical Imperative). This morality (<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/">Deontology</a>), is directly opposed to <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/">Utilitarianism</a> which is <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/">John Stuart Mill‚Äôs</a> and <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bentham/">Jeremy Bentham‚Äôs</a> moral principle of the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. Yet both theories are objectionable because morality is more ambiguous than that. And it neglects the most important model of human conduct which is the struggle to be free. Whatever your goal, to build character or to be virtuous, the most important is to be free. The early philosophers for the most part were interpreting the world in various ways. But the point of it all is to change it.</p>
