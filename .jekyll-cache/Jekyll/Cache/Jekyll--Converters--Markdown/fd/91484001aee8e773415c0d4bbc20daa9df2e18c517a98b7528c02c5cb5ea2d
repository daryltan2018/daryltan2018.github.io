I"ê<p>Because of work commitments, there‚Äôs been a lack of updates from me..</p>

<p>But on Friday, while wandering around a bookstore, I saw an updated version of David Allen‚Äôs GTD on the shelf. Purchased a copy and eased myself into a chair in the nearby cafe, I started to get excited about implementing some of his ideas into my own GTD system. In fact this post stemmed from some of those ideas and breathed a bit of life into this dying blog.</p>

<p>But the bottom line version is that using a mix of Apple reminders, lists and an enlightened understanding of what getting things done means, I‚Äôm experimenting with a new method of being more productive‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Getting Things Done (or GTD) is all about actions and outcomes.</p>

<p>So for instance, this blog post is an outcome. Sitting in front of my laptop and typing it out is an action.</p>

<p>To implement the framework, I needed a tool for capturing and what better tool than my trusty ‚ÄúReminders‚Äù app. I captured various ideas, errands, projects, stuff .. everything that David Allen calls an ‚Äúopen loop‚Äù into the app.</p>

<p>Next, all the stuff that I received, I clarified by asking myself if it was actionable. If yes, then I figured out what the next action is. If no, then I trashed it or put it into incubation for later.</p>

<p>Once I had all my open loops, I organised them into various lists named under different contexts like home, office, errands etc.</p>

<p>Then I reflected on all the items I had and decided, given the 4 levels of constraints (context, time, energy and priority) on which task to engage first.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a damm useful framework for procrastinators like me.</p>
