I"a<p>The catalyst for me starting the <a href="/notes">philosophy</a> project was the book “The Story of Philosophy”. The writer, Will Durant, dives deep into the lives of some of the most famous philosophers - Aristotle, Plato, Nietzsche, Kant, Spinoza and more. The more I read, the more I wanted to learn about philosophy; the different schools of thought and their champions. And as I read I realised that the terms were shockingly alien to me. What is metaphysics? What is epistemology? What is truth? What is morality? So as I explored further, I remembered listening to the podcast “The Partially Examined Life”. It gave me some semblance of a structure as I started to chip away at the tip of this very large iceberg. Perhaps if this project keeps my interest I will write a bit more specifically on the learnings and contemplations in this blog.</p>
