It is not absolutism, which is the view that at least some truths are universal and not bound by historical or social conditions.

It is not monism that argues that there can be no more than one correct opinion, judgment or norm.

## The History of Relativism

The champion of this idea can be first attributed to Protagoras and his dictum

> Man is the measure of all things

Or in other words, 

> Each thing appears to me, so it is for me, and it appears to you, so it is for you - you and I each being a man.

Plato's refutation of this is known as *peritrope* which is one attempt to show that relativism refutes itself. For instance, if one says that there is no absolute truth but only relative truth, then one can question that statement by asking if that is an absolute truth?
