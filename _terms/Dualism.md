## What is Dualism?
In the philosophy of mind, dualism is the theory that the mental and the physical (mind vs body) are radically different things. 

## What is Substance Dualism?
Descartes was a substance dualist. He believed that there were two kinds of substance: matter, of which the essential property is that it is spatially extended; and mind, of which the essential property is that it thinks. 

The main uncertainty that faced Descartes and his contemporaries, however, was not where interaction took place, but how two things so different as thought and extension could interact at all.
