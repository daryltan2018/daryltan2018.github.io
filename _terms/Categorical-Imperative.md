## What is the Categorical Imperative?

The Categorical Imperative is the fundamental principle of our moral **duty**. The term was coined by Immanuel Kant. It is categorical because it applies to us *unconditionally*, without consideration of the consequences. 

## The Universal Law of Nature

According to Kant, this is the first formulation of the Categorical Imperative, which you are to "act only in accordance with that maxim (..) which you can (..) will that it become a universal law"

## The Humanity Formula

According to Kant, we should never act in such a way that we treat humanity as a a means only but always as an end in itself.

## The Autonomy Formula

According to Kant, we should legislate our universal laws according to our status as rational beings with autonomy.

## The Kingdom of Ends Formula

It is a Kantian formulation for "A Systematic union of different rational beings under common laws".

It argues that our primary moral obligation is acting only on principles that are accepted by a community of fully rational agents.
