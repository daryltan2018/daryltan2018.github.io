## What are Monads?

 Leibniz rejected the Cartesian view on matter (see [Dualism](/Dualism)) and held instead that only beings endowed with true unity and capable of action can count as substances. This is evident in his work *The Monadology*, in that the only beings that will count as genuine substances and hence be considered real are mind-like simple substances endowed with perception and appetite(ie Monads).
