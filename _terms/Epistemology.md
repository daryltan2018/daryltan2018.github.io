## What is Epistemology?
It is the study of *knowledge* and *justified belief*.

## What is Knowledge?
The particular knowledge is pertaining to the knowledge of a proposition. Three conditions are necessary for knowledge - Truth, belief and justification. A proposition needs to be true, therefore knowledge requires truth. A person needs to believe it to be true, therefore knowledge requires belief. A person needs to be correct in the proposition with the right justification (as opposed to luck), therefore knowledge requires justification.
